# Fortio TLS reverse proxy
Runs as a front end (ingress) for other services to provide TLS (https autocert with letsencrypt/acme) and routing

If you want to connect to fortio (or any other service you may have) using https and to provide real TLS certificates, or to multiplex grpc and regular http services behind a single port, check out [Fortio Proxy](https://github.com/fortio/proxy#fortio-proxy)

## Installation

If you have golang, easiest install is `go install fortio.org/proxy@latest`

Or with docker `docker run fortio/proxy ...`

Otherwise head over to [github proxy release page](https://github.com/fortio/proxy/releases) for binary releases
