# duration

A zero dependency library to overcome issues with lack of days and weeks in standard library's duration as well as ease parsing for common date/times and print durations without zeroes (eg `1d3m` instead of `24h3m0s`) - it originated in [tclock](tclock) and is available also via [dflag](dflag) for dynamic flag (includes regular duration.Flag for simple flags parsing with new duration in days and weeks).

See details at [github.com/fortio/duration](https://github.com/fortio/duration#duration)
