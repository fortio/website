Fortio's term is a fork of [golang.org/x/term](https://github.com/golang/term) with added features (like exposed History) pending their upstream acceptance.

It's wrapped into [fortio.org/terminal](terminal.md) to provide even easier integration and higher level API.

See [github/fortio/term](https://github.com/fortio/term#term)
